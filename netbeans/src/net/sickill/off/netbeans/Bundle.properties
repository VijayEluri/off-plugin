    <h1>Open File Fast</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Open File Fast</strong> is a plugin for <a href="http://netbeans.org">Netbeans IDE</a> which allows you to quickly find and open files in your projects.\
    </p>\n<p>It is inspired by <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate's</a> quick open file dialog. \
    However, it has a lot more features. \
    Basically it works like this: you type only several characters of filename you are searching for and you get list of all files matching your pattern. \
    For example, when you are looking for FooBar.java you can type <em>fbj</em> and you will find it. \
    It really helps navigating through the project (especially bigger ones) as you don't need to use a mouse nor locate a filename visually in project tree but just use filename shortcuts.\
    </p>\n<h2>Download</h2>\n<p>You can download the plugins from the <a href="https://github.com/sickill/off-plugin/releases">releases page</a>.\
    <br>\nThe NetBeans plugin can be downloaded from the NetBeans Plugin Portal <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/16495/open-file-fast">&le;8.0</a>, <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/63478/open-file-fast">&ge;8.1</a></p>\n\n\n<h2>Key features of Open File Fast</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Quick finding and opening any file from selected project</li>\n\t<li>Two matching modes:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><em>Smart</em> (like in Textmate, matching filenames must contain all typed characters, they can be separated by other characters)</li>\n\t\t<li><em>Exact</em> (like Netbeans' Go-To-File, matching filenames must contain exact phrase)</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Matching from start of filename or anywhere in filename</li>\n\t<li>Support for * wildcard in <em>exact</em> mode</li>\n\t<li>Changing minimum entered pattern length needed for searching (default: 3)</li>\n\t<li>Changing delay (time from last keystroke) after which searching starts (default: 300ms)</li>\n\t<li>Optional cleaning of search input field when O-F-F window opens</li>\n\t<li>Hiding files you don't work on (matching specified regular expresions) from results</li>\n\t<li>Moving less important files (matching specified regular expresions) to the bottom of results list</li>\n\t<li>Results sorted by:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>File popularity (files opened frequently at the top of list)</li>\n\t\t<li>Match accuracy (distance between characters from search phrase in matched filenames)</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Opening multiple files at once (selected with ctrl/shift + mouse)</li>\n\t<li>Switching between search history entries by CTRL-Up/CTRL-Down</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<p>Open File Fast plugin installs itself in Netbeans' <i>Navigate</i> menu as <i>Open File Fast</i>. \
    I recommend creating a keyboard shortcut for it in <em>Tools/Options/Keymap/Project</em>.\
    </p>\n<p>When invoked, it opens a search dialog. \
    Type <em>some</em> characters from filename you want to find. \
    <em>Some</em> as you may skip any characters you want. \
    Use * as a placeholder for any text. \
    You can narrow down the search to files in specified directory by typing a directory prefix followed by slash and then a filename pattern.\
    </p>\n<p>For example, type:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>user</em> when looking for <em>user.rb</em> or <em>UberServer.java</em></li>\n\t<li><em>ush</em> when looking for <em>users_helper.rb</em></li>\n\t<li><em>*.js</em> when you want to list all javascript files (<em>*</em> is not needed here if "Matching from start of filename" is turned off in preferences)</li>\n\t<li><em>a/m/</em> when you want to list all files in <em>app/models</em> directory</li>\n\t<li><em>a/v/s</em> when you are looking for <em>show.html</em> in <em>app/views</em> directory</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Open File Fast can be set up to your own preferences and to match your own workflow. \
    You can configure it under <em>Open File Fast</em> tab in Netbeans' <em>Miscellaneous</em> options.\

    <ul>\n\t\t<li>This is included by default in the standard Java SE and Java EE variations.\
    </li>\n\t\t<li>If you're using the C/C++ or HTML5 &amp; PHP bundles, you will probably need to install the <em>NetBeans Plugin Development</em> plugin.\
    </li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Clone this repo.\
    </li>\n\t<li>In NetBeans, go to <em>File</em> \u2013 <em>Open Project\u2026</em>, navigate to the <em>netbeans</em> subdir in the repo and open it.\n\t\
    <ul>\n\t\t<li>The dir should have a special icon. \
    If it doesn't, your installation probably doesn't have the <em>NetBeans Plugin Development</em> plugin.\
    </li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Right click on the project and select <em>Create NBM</em>.\
    </li>\n\t<li>If all goes well, this should create a <em>net-sickill-off.nbm</em> file in the <em>netbeans/build</em> dir of the repo.\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Provide defects, request for enhancements and feedback at <a href="https://github.com/sickill/off-plugin/issues">https://github.com/sickill/off-plugin/issues</a></p>\n<p>Compatible to >=NB 8.0.2</p>\n<p>Legal disclaimer: Code is licensed under MIT</p>

OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Open File Fast allows for quick finding and opening project files by entering only few characters of filename. It's like Textmate's or Netbeans' Go-To-File dialog but on steroids!
