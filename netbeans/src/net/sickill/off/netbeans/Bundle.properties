OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Open File Fast is inspired by Textmate's quick open file dialog however it has a lot more features. \
    Basically it works like this: you type only several characters of filename you are searching for and you get list of all files matching your pattern. \
    For example when you are looking for FooBar.java you can type fbj and you will find it. \
    It really helps navigating through the project (especially bigger ones) as you don't need to use a mouse nor locate filename visually in project tree but just use filename shortcuts.\n\n\n\

OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Open File Fast allows for quick finding and opening project files by entering only few characters of filename. It's like Textmate's or Netbeans' Go-To-File dialog but on steroids!
